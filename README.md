## Limitations ⚠️

- **News Analysis Reliability**: Sentiment and news analysis features rely on LLMs and may not always be reliable, especially for news related to China.
- **Local Politicians Excluded**: The app does not track local politicians as they are not legally required to disclose their trades.
- **Not an Auto-Investment App**: This app provides qualitative information for decision-making and does not automate investments.
