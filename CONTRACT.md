# Team Contract ðŸ“œ

## Communication Practices
- **GitHub**: This will serve as our primary communication channel.
- **Meetings**: Meetings will be scheduled as needed outside of class hours, at the team's discretion. The instructor will intervene if a team member refuses to contribute to the work.
- **Early is On Time**: We will strive to set reminders and meet deadlines ahead of schedule.

## Meeting Deadlines
- **Early Submissions**: All assignments will be completed at least three hours before the deadline.
- **Missed Deadlines**: Any missed deadlines will be treated as urgent and flagged accordingly.
- **High Collaboration**: Collaboration on missed assignments will be encouraged, and help will be distributed among the team.

## Ethics
- **Late Assignments**: Late assignments will be treated as urgent. We will reflect on what went wrong during team meetings and discuss how to prevent similar issues in the future.
- **Cheating**: If cheating occurs, the individual will be required to re-learn the material and share the lessons learned with the team.
- **Impasse**: Should there be a dispute on what should be done, all members will be consulted, and if there is still a dispute, all members will have to decide what to do. If it is a simple yes-or-no dispute, then 2/3 will decide how to move forward, and if it is more nuanced, and none can agree to anything, then the founder (Shumaker) will give an ultimatum. 

## Standards
- **Product Readiness**: The product will be ready for demonstration at the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) stage.
- **Development Approach**: We will follow Agile principles and continuous development, ensuring the project evolves until the end of the course.

## Group Contract Non-Adherence
- **Consequences**: Failure to adhere to this contract will result in a team discussion to address the issue. Repeated violations may require instructor intervention.
