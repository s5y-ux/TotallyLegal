# 1. Business Requirements üèõÔ∏è

## 1.1 Background
In recent years, the stock and trading market has gained significant popularity, leading to increased public curiosity about politicians' stock and investment histories. The interaction between politicians and financial markets has garnered attention, and this application aims to track such interactions in real time. Competitors like Quiver Quantitative, House Watch, and Join Autopilot already offer services that track politician trading history and provide investment insights to users.

## 1.2 Business Opportunity
This application will provide users with information on how members of Congress are trading in the market. This information reflects the confidence of Congress members, who have access to more information about present and future legislation, in specific market sectors or the market as a whole. Our competitive edge will be the centralized news feature, which offers more comprehensive information compared to competitors who only provide basic trade data.

## 1.3 Vision Statement
The application will serve as a valuable resource for financial analysts and political activists by providing insights into the trades made by members of Congress. Given that many Congress members outperform most hedge funds, their trading patterns offer valuable information. Additionally, since Congress regulates and subsidizes industries, their legislative actions directly influence the market.

# 2. Scope and Limitations

## 2.1 Major Features
- **Totally Legal** will allow users to view individual trades made by politicians.
- Real-time news in politics and economics will be centralized to help users make informed stock trading decisions.
- Unlike competitors, the app will not track ETFs but will show individual trades, providing all necessary information in one place.

## 2.2 Limitations and Exclusions
- Politicians have 45 days to disclose their trades, so the data will not be in real-time (disclosure dates will be included).
- Sentiment and news analysis features may not be entirely reliable as they rely on the output of LLMs, especially concerning China.
- The app will not track local politicians as they are not legally required to disclose their trades.
- This is not an auto-investment app like Autopilot; it provides qualitative information for decision-making based on global events.

## 2.3 Minor Features
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Users can run sentiment analysis on news articles to speculate on politicians' investment motivations.
- **Politician Tracking**: Users can track specific politicians.
- **Leaderboard**: A leaderboard will show which politicians are performing the best.
- **S&P 500 Comparison**: A feature to compare politicians' returns against the S&P 500 will help users gauge market performance.
